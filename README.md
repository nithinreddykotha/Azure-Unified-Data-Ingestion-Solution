# Azure-Unified-Data-Ingestion-Solution
An enterprise-grade Azure ETL framework that implements a metadata-driven medallion architecture to standardize and streamline data ingestion. The solution organizes data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers and uses a single, configurable pipeline to orchestrate data movement and transformation between layers, reducing operational complexity and eliminating the maintenance overhead of managing multiple, fragmented ingestion workflows.
